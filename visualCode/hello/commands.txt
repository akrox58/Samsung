I got the same error, given I was behind a corporate firewall/proxy and my connection was passed the proxy's certificate.

In your command line run:


npm config set strict-ssl false

NOTE: that this is not best practice to blindly accept untrusted or invalid SSL certificates, which is what the command does (turn off certificate checking). You can run


npm config set strict-ssl true

to turn it back on.
