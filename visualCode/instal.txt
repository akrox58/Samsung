reate a REST-ful application that allows users to store code snippets. 
* Use HAPI for the server (http://hapijs.com/)
* Have swagger documentation (https://github.com/glennjones/hapi-swagger)
* Have Joi validation (https://github.com/hapijs/joi)

Example code snippet payload:
{
    id: “user-provided-identitifer for this snipet”,
    “language”: “js/python/c++/c/etc”,
    “code”: “actual code snippet”,
    “createdDate”: “date this snippet was created”,
    “modifiedDate”: “date this snippet was modified”
    … feel free to modify/add more to this payload
}

Use HAPI to expose the following endpoints:

Create a new snippet:

POST /snippets/

GET /snippets/{id}

GET /snippets -> Get all snippets belonging to the user.

Have a fixed list of users in a config file. The userKey/userName should be sent as part of the request headers and not as a path/query/body parameter.


DELETE /snippets/{id}

Bonus:

PUT /snippet/{id}
Update a given snippet, make sure a user can only update his own snippet.

Return proper error codes: http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html
